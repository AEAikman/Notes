MAYA ITEMS
Maya notes
use hRig
Everything bound to a joint
at most max influences of 4
no geo parented under joints or geo
not geo parented under geo
When selecting geo and joints to skin, use the button Select Jnt and Geo under hAutoRig
Otherwise the headCtrl may be selected from the rig group 
only the skeleton and geo should be selected when skinning
you may then select or deselect geo from the geo group
geo can have the suffix geo
but only the top geo group can have geo
no subgroups
geo delete non deformer history and freeze transforms
Inherits Transform off on Geo group, otherwise you get double transforms
pivot point
combine geo if possible
material id consciousness
Heavy Mesh

Sequencer advantages
	
repeatable
rendering doesn't require purging mem etc
Undo possible
Save possible
sequencer interface improvements
No need for level blueprint, but no hide player bool
Set Start and end time
Custom Start Time/End Time/Warmup Time when rendering
4k rez preset
Can create folders with Ctrl + Shift + N
No 300mm lens crash
Actors can exist as spawnables in level sequence and therefore be repeated
warm up frame count
sequencer fbx import export
media framework overhaul
Bugfix: Fixed an issue where Skeletal Animations would evaluate one frame ahead of where they were supposed to be.
replacing camera is very easy
camera import rotation of group not necessary, but cam rotation still is. (see MayaToUnreal_Camera_007_aa.mel)
end frame may need to be split in order to not reset.  Solution: always export extra frames
Shift D and Shift C for Cine Preview
sequencer is def better in terms of deleting stuff with level sequence open, saving, etc.
better for single monitor
make sure to have the right level sequence open
Maya Keying Hotkeys
Camera : (LEGACY) Must place regular camera in scene (can right-click, make sure is not CineCam), copy Field of View from Angle of View in Maya, drag cam into sequencer, make sure auto play is on in seq, select camera, click Eye icon, import, import cam fbx for seq, check frame range, double check fov, create camera cut group, click "+ camera" on camera cut group then select camera (like director track), make sure "Keep Playback Range in Selection Bounds" on in option of sequencer, make sure the correct level sequence is selected after opening a new scene, make sure it at 24 fps, render.

Camera : Create level sequence and save in shot folder. Set LS to Auto Play.  In Sequencer, click the camera icon to create a camera and automatically assign it to the Camera Cuts track.  Select the new camera and click the Eye icon next to the camera, then click Import and choose your camera fbx, making sure it is for Sequencer (denoted by the _SEQ suffix in the filename).  Select the camera, and in the details panel, expand Filmback Settings, and change Sensor Width and Sensor Height based upon the Camera Aperature in mm from Maya. Double check frame rate and range.  Click the Slate icon and render 

JPG very fast but less info than PNG, probably negligible advantage
export 3 frames of head and 1 frame of tail on everything (cam and anm, but don't offset cam frames) and it should work perfectly.
Folders and labels in sequencer
media player/texture more streamlined
hide player optional through "Set Cinematic mode" in PVC
potential future alembic import
quick lens change options in the engine with the new cine cam


Sequencer Disadvantages

no quit when done for PIE (circumvented through PostVisControl)
Cine Cam needs aperature set
exports need extra frames to be accurate
Need to Create a new LS every scene and then check on autoplay
Media framework still doesn't render correctly or scrub
previous media framework is no longer functional
no arrow keys to move keys or reorganize tracks
Can't add multiple actors to the same group
Assigning a new actor to an existing group may disrupt that ability for the original actor to be dragged into the level sequence
