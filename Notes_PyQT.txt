 Python QT notes 



Was able to implement the uic successfully, using compileUiDir, since I have multiple .ui files. Final code was:

from PyQt4 import uic
folderToConvert = r'filePathGoesHere'
uic.compileUiDir(folderToConvert,recurse=False)
This is a .py file that I run or call/execute prior to running the main program. Very handy!
