git checkout file to reset

git checkout -- '*.c'

Note the quotes around *.c. The file hello.c will also be checked out, even though it is no longer in the working tree, because the file globbing is used to match entries in the index (not in the working tree by the shell).

note on checkout is that it simply make sure the local is up to date, it doesn't checkout like in perforce

git push origin <your-git-branch> (typically 'master', but not always)
Remove directory from git but NOT local

As mentioned in the comments, what you usually want to do is remove this directory from git but not delete it entirely from the filesystem (local)

TO REMOVE ONLY FROM GIT

git rm -r --cached myFolder

MORE REMOVAL NOTES

To remove folder/directory only from git repository and not from the local try 3 simple steps.

Steps to remove directory

git rm -r --cached FolderName
git commit -m "Removed folder from repository"
git push origin master
Steps to ignore that folder in next commits

To ignore that folder from next commits make one file in root named .gitignore and put that folders name into it. You can put as many as you want
