Documentation notes as of NOV 2016
cine cam and seq advanced notes
head and tail in export scripts
choose 0 frame for anim
clicking camera to constrain to viewport (camera cuts = all, on camera track = selected viewport)
seq shift click to snap to key
right-clicking to load
if textures keep streaming in render, try restarting engine
sequencer keying issues
camera script
make sure to update ls if saving as in a ls
save as ls first to avoid overwriting old one
adding content from vault cache by copying to local vault cache and "adding to project"
shift select last key of cam focal length to get frame range
sequencer keying bug
drag in sequencer slider to be able to use keys to move frames
select track and use keys in seq to be able to cycle through tracks
cine cam dof explanation
scrub in seq after change to details to see it
auto key to keep keys made
light falloff exponent
split anm track to deal with visibility toggle popping in from start position
player shown in sequncer?
pasting must be done in an existing track
sphere ref capture actor hidden in game?
labels?
clipping planes?
may need to restart for render/render settings reload?
player start to hide player
find ls in cb to insert into LS actor
new level, new ls, mag glass, insert into ls actor
point light setup
light inverse falloff settings
template ls
make sure to open current LS when opening a new scene
seq duplicate keys missing alt drag
matching ls to level is very important
if camera breaks, create a new one (watch for dof and aperture settings)
auto quit for pie?
pay attention to lighting channels
Use mag glass on ls to make sure you are using the right one
ls save as vs save all trickiness
ls last key if there for end of seq
static lighting baking?
postvis layer update using byte or int (switch on int) for extensible layers?
if weird shadows > check near clip plane
for floats (sometimes) > use 0. instead of . etc
troubleshooting engine import issues > Cleanup > Zbrush optimze point order, weld points, fix mesh integrity
choke > Power
import camera first to save folder for import
split and drag in seq to fix end frames trick
grouping with ctrl+G
Duplicated child unparent fixed now
actor initial position trickiness
seq scroll on left window only
bug with visibility switchs stopping working - have to redo atm
actor hidden in game track can break (FIXED)
OpenStreetMapPlugin
sequencer is not always representative of what you will get
if sequencer is all red, you likely need to make sure you are in the correct LS
recommended folder structure (e.g. hUnreal, Assets, etc)
to fix scale issues > target actor and scale, but no static objects
sequencer material parameters
HelperUpdate for 4.14
SpawnParticleOnColission
head = 1
tail = 5
emphasize the relationship between level and level sequence
doesn't render all the way > may need to restart
sequencer tends to have a number of visibility track issues
be careful with auto key and camera
camera imports to 0 automatically
to slide camera in master scene, need to move all camera keys and adjust start/end frames
if rotation locks, slide in field transform or close seq
Visibility is bad
don't forget actor anm and sequencer anm
use preroll frames in sequencer renderer if needed for post process effects etc
make sure light is set to movable when keying in matinee
source control notes (use or don't use, don't add Saved (or intermediate) folder)
make sure camera enabled in fbx settings for camera export
<<< LAUNCHY documention >>>
Show frames through snap settings in Matinee?
banding from texture compression (vectorDisplacement)
auto activate on fx?
Engine publish system
when creating env reference folders, keep everything in one head folder so it can be collapsed
make documentation have more images - be easier to read
git for ue4?
custom render pass for sep trans A
actor merging update (Window > Developer Tools > Actor Merging Tab)
buffer visualization
make use of lighting model for holdout?
for stencil post process, make sure stencil is enabled in rendering
for holdout Apply post process Material (e.g. stencil), then add Post Tone HDR Color to custom render pass and render
make sure to reopen render settings if needed
custom render pass with holdout as final image and PostProcess Tone map 
add materials library project  

Add info about who needs to know about ddc  
Add note about which content browser search field to type in  
Note about importing unskinned geo with animation  
Note about post tonemap HDR color render pass in 4.13 and above 
clarify that a vert cannot have more than 4 influences not geo

where to save
save project? = no
"actor" clarification
clarify "save all process"
mat vs Seq check doc for clarity
camera cuts track vs having it already in the template

spawnable!
decals
attach track on child in Sequencer
how to turn off autosave
split anm track in sequ in order to extend
go over master material
expand master material
weird light at origin issue and how to compensate (lift env)
note about being able to drag animation into sequencer on top of actor track to input animations
spawnable now the preferred method in seq
'\(.+\)' = regex to find () for cc maker
Actually '(-)?[01]\.\d{3,5}' is better as it finds both sat and sop values
'\d\.\d+(?=\s\()' will find just the sat values
'[A-z]{3}(0)\d{3}(?=\s)' finds a shot name as long as the number isn't above 0999
locking details panel and adding actors to variable
if can't drag into seq, click Add button to add track to seq
ls won't play, and everything is hooked up, try recreating the cameras cuts track in case it is buggy
discuss potential scale issues
outline simple lerp
collapsed emitter in cascade
engine scalability settings
to copy keys in seq > select and right click in the track window instead of the group window
sometimes don't replace EditorPerProjectUserSettings.ini
HLSL Custom node

if texture changes during render, may need to prerun frames
install symbols for debugging?
Clarify Static mesh vs skeletal mesh
disabling plugin warning
switching engine version
pivot/world origin concerns
if weird reflections > check skylight for captured scene
Distance field shadows
cast translucent shadows
the need to apply changes in Mat Editor
Cable actors and physics contraint actors
Note that migrate initially outlines dependencies
may have to close and reopen the engine for dependecies to be properly calculated
autosave is useless
demo "basic material"

Invalid Bind Pose
When you bound the skin to the joints, did you have remove unused influences checked?
if so, unchecking that, may fix that issue in unreal
Alternatively, you could try checkin Use T0As Ref Pose when importing into unreal

Scaling Joints works sometimes (need anm)

Add "Hide Children" to Postvis suite

*********************

If hud in the way, override game mode orrr find hud bp and break connections
Moving Camera cuts track start to include frame 0
no ssr issue may require switching to temporal AA
standards for saving ENV files in Assets > ENV > $Name > Models Subfolder with levels above
where to access projects - folder vs epic launcher
be careful about deleting projects from "My Projects" in Epic Games Launcher
For Save As Crash - delete EditorPerProjectUserSetting.ini only
Update hRig to not break on geo
if rig breaks on reimport or import over, then delete and reimport asset
level building practice - place env assets in ENV folder
ray traced distance field shadows (note "cast inset shadow" for skeletal meshes)
if bounds are weird check physics asset and make sure the volumes look ok.  if not, right click skel mesh and create and assign physics asset
Particle  material can allow custom depth writes for additional shader compile
Option to completely disable texture streaming in project settings
if filmback won't hold, make cam possessable
confirmed copy just the correct editorPerProjectUserSettings.ini

FLEX
In particle, assign container
Container holds max particle values
probably turn off process burst list in flex module in emitter
turn on Multi-body over lap on actors you want the flex particle to interact with
material values are set on the material linked in the fluid container which itself needs to be linked in the required module of the particle system

If world composition is auto loading hella levels, turn off enable world composition and set desired levels to always loaded

Whether to use ShotControlNumber to automatically link the ShotControl in the scene without having to select it (or deselect actors).  To find this number, hover over the actor in the world outliner, and input what comes after the last underscore into the ShotControlNumber variable.  Then click AssignShotControl.  If off, the helper will find the ShotControl when it is selected, as per usual.


go over master material
