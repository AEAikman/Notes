Highlighting a bunch of lines then hitting Cmd (Ctrl?) +Shift+L gives you multi-cursors on each line. I do that, followed by Cmd + Right arrow (End?) to get easily get a cursor at the end of a series of lines to simultaneously type something after each.


Alt + F3 select all occurrences of current word for multiple editing. Very useful.

Ctrl+Shift+K	delete line
Ctrl+Enter	insert line after
Ctrl+Shift+Enter	insert line before
Ctrl+Shift+Up or Down	move line (or selection) up
Ctrl+KK	delete from cursor to end of line
Ctrl+]	indent current line(s)
Ctrl+[	un-indent current line(s)
Ctrl+Shift+D	duplicate line(s)
Ctrl+ /	comment/un-comment current line
Ctrl+Shift+/	block comment current selection

Ctrl+J	join line below to the end of the current line


Ctrl+P	quick-open files by name in your project (doesn’t seem to need an actual project set up, it just searches in the directories around the currently-opened file
Ctrl+R	goto symbol (functions and classes) in the file. Same as Ctrl+P, then type @
Ctrl+;	goto word in current file. Same as Ctrl+P, then type #
Ctrl+G	goto line in current file. Same as Ctrl+P, then type :

General

Ctrl+Shift+P	command prompt
Ctrl+KB	toggle side bar


Find/Replace

Ctrl+F	find
Ctrl+H	replace
Ctrl+Shift+F	find in files

Tabs

Ctrl+Shift+t	open last closed tab (just like in your browser)
Ctrl+PgDn	cycle down through open tabs, cycle up with Ctrl+PgUp
Ctrl+Left or Right	cycle through last tabs (repeat to go back further in history)


Split window

Alt+Shift+2	split into two columns
Alt+Shift+1	revert to single column
Alt+Shift+5	grid (4 groups)
Ctrl+[1,2,3,4]	jump to "group" (pane)
Ctrl+Shift+[1,2,3,4]	move file to specified group

Ctrl+Click to create cursor spot

Ctrl+Shift+V	paste and indent correctly

Ctrl+Shift+L Add cursors to selected lines
